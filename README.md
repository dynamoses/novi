I didn't want to use frameworks or libraries for a small project so I coded everything manually using vanilla JS.

The js functions handle the sliding filters panel and the filtering of the job categories, I didn't add functionality for pagination or search by typing but have rendered a block where it would be.

I used BEM for my naming conventions and sass variables for my frequently used values.
